# Build smart contract

This learning experience established a strong foundation in Ethereum smart contract creation, deployment, and interaction. Through practical tasks and progress documentation on GitHub, I gained hands-on experience and developed a representative portfolio. I learned to create ERC20 tokens, manage hashed messages on the blockchain, and automate contract interactions using ethers.js. Furthermore, I investigated zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee management and token balance oversight.
